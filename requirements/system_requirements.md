### **Existing Systems in Place**
- **Clickstream Data Ingestion:** A system already exists to ingest raw clickstream data into a data lake (Minio), but there is no transformation or quality assurance mechanism in place.
- **Data Lake (Minio):** Used to store raw clickstream data from user interactions and content meta data.


### **New System Requirements**

#### **Functional Requirements:**
- **Data Access:** The system must provide a user-friendly interface that enables stakeholders to easily access and query datasets for reporting and analysis.
- **Data Transformation:** The system must be capable of transforming raw clickstream data and other data sources into structured, meaningful datasets for analysis.
- **Data Quality Checks:** The system must implement automated processes to ensure the accuracy and completeness of data through quality checks during data processing.
- **Data Ingestion Scheduling:** The system must support daily updates to ingest the most current user interactions and ensure data freshness.
- **Alerting Mechanism:** The system must have an alerting feature that notifies stakeholders of any delays in data ingestion or quality issues, allowing for timely intervention.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements:**
- **Performance:** The system should efficiently handle large volumes of data and provide timely access to stakeholders, minimizing latency in data retrieval.
- **Scalability:** The system must be designed to scale as Storeezâ€™s user base and content library grow, accommodating increased data loads and processing needs.
- **Reliability:** The system should ensure high availability and fault tolerance, minimizing downtime and ensuring stakeholders can consistently access data.
- **Security:** The system must implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data and ensure that only authorized users have access to specific datasets.
- **Usability:** The system should be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing stakeholders with varying levels of technical expertise to easily navigate and utilize the data.
