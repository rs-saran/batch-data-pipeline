#### **Tools and Technologies**

To meet the system requirements and effectively address the needs of stakeholders, the following tools and technologies have been chosen:

- **Apache Spark (Transformations in Data Lake):**  
  Spark will be used to process and transform raw clickstream data in the data lake into structured, meaningful datasets. Its ability to handle large volumes of data in a distributed manner will ensure efficient data processing, enabling quick insights into user behavior.

- **dbt (Transformations in Data Warehouse):**  
  dbt (data build tool) will facilitate data transformations in the data warehouse, allowing analysts and data scientists to create reliable, reusable data models. This will help maintain data integrity and ensure that stakeholders have access to consistent datasets for reporting and analysis.

- **DuckDB (Data Warehousing):**  
  DuckDB will be utilized for data warehousing, providing an efficient platform for analytical queries. It will store the transformed data, enabling rapid access for analysis and reporting while supporting complex query execution on large datasets.

- **Great Expectations (Data Quality Checks):**  
  Great Expectations will be employed to implement automated data quality checks during the data transformation process. It will help ensure the accuracy and completeness of the datasets, providing stakeholders with confidence in the data they use for decision-making.

- **Apache Airflow (Orchestration):**  
  Airflow will serve as the orchestration tool to manage and schedule the data workflows across Spark and dbt. This will enable seamless integration of different tasks in the data pipeline, ensuring that data is ingested, transformed, and made available to stakeholders in a timely manner.

- **Slack (Alerting Stakeholders):**  
  Slack will be utilized for real-time communication with stakeholders. It will facilitate alerts regarding delays in data ingestion or any quality issues, allowing stakeholders to respond promptly and maintain data reliability.

- **Metabase (Analysis and Reporting):**  
  Metabase will be used for data analysis and reporting, providing stakeholders with an intuitive interface to visualize and explore data. It will empower them to create dashboards and reports that help track user engagement and content performance, leading to informed decision-making.
