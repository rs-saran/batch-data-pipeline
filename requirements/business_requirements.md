#### **Business Requirements**
Storeez aims to grow its platform by enhancing user engagement with its diverse content offerings, including books, comics, movies, TV series, and audiobooks. The overarching goal is to utilize data to understand user interactions and preferences, enabling Storeez to make data-driven decisions that improve user satisfaction and optimize content offerings. 

#### **Stakeholder Requirements**
Stakeholders across Storeez require access to reliable and actionable data to perform their roles effectively. The company faces challenges in identifying which content resonates with different user segments, given its growing user base and expanding content library. The raw data in the data lake is not accessible to stakeholders and is not suitable for immediate analysis, requiring transformations, quality checks, and structured storage.

To address these challenges, stakeholders need:

- **Easy Access to Data**: Enable easy access to data for reporting and analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Transform raw clickstream data and other sources into meaningful datasets.
- **Data Quality Assurance**: Ensure data accuracy and completeness.
- **Timely Updates**: Stakeholders specified a need for daily updates to ensure that the data reflects the most current user interactions.
- **Alerts for Issues**: Stakeholders want to be informed and alerted whenever there is a delay in data ingestion or a problem with data quality.
